# DevSphere – Developer Blog CMS

DevSphere is a **tech-focused blog Content Management System (CMS)** for developers and students to create, manage, and read programming-related articles.

It’s built to showcase **real-world frontend engineering skills**: authentication, CRUD operations, dashboards, responsive UI, and integration with a backend-as-a-service (Supabase).

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsphere.git
cd devsphere
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Supabase

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2. Get your:

   * **Project URL**
   * **Anon public key**
3. Create the `posts` table (see schema above).
4. Enable Row Level Security and create basic policies.
5. Create a **Storage bucket** (e.g. `post-images`) for cover images.

### 4️⃣ Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 5️⃣ Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at:
`http://localhost:5173` (or similar, depending on Vite)

## 🚢 Deployment

You can deploy DevSphere using:

### ▶️ Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import your repo.
3. Add the environment variables:

   * `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   * `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Deploy the app.

### ▶️ Netlify

Alternatively, you can also use Netlify by:

1. Connecting your GitHub repo.
2. Setting the build command: `npm run build`
3. Setting the output directory: `dist`
4. Adding the same environment variables.
